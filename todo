gumbell-softmax vs gumbell sigmoid
mutag adjacency matrix padding?
find hyperparameters and test
    lambda in discriminator gradient penalty
    binarization threshold, maybe higher threshold? or adj = torch.bernoulli(adj)
    temperature in gumbell-softmax
    generator NN model
degree constraint loss?
more epochs for generator
ensure there aren't singleton nodes
graph transformer to learn representation maybe? instead of generator
